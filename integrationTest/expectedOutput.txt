 More simplicity
 How about a number? 1900
 How about a second number? 1901
 How about a double? 0.110000
 How about a nice little string? Stephen Rocks!
 A middle "Stephen Rocks!" string?
 And another string? yolo swag! blah.
 One that should be "end"? end
 Hello world number 2 of 10 (0.20%)! This is Stephen!
 This is a string of many strings, like this one, this other one, and this third one with a number 12345670 and a final string with spacers              far out

 Let's try out all the types!
Pointer = 0x7ffe075cbe7d
uint8_t = 10
uint16_t = 33
uint32_t = 99991
uint64_t = 18446744073709551615
float = 121.121002
double = 212.212000
hexadecimal = ff
Just a normal character = a
 how about some negative numbers?
int8_t -10
int16_t -33
int32_t -99991
int64_t -1
int -12356
 How about variable width + precision?  12345.12        123        end

 13) Yup
ie
 13.5) This should be =2: 2
 14) Hello 5
 14) Hello 6
 15) This should not be incremented twice (=1):1
 15) This should be incremented once more (=2):2
 16) Hello /* uncool */
 17) This is rediculous
